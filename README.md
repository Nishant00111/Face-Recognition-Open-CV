# Face Recognition with OpenCV Haar Cascade Classifier
## Description
This project demonstrates face recognition using the OpenCV Haar Cascade classifier. Haar Cascade is a machine learning object detection method used to identify objects for which a classifier has been trained. In this case, we use a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in images or video streams.

# How it Works
The OpenCV Haar Cascade classifier is a machine learning model trained to detect faces. It works by scanning an image or video frame for regions that match a set of learned features. When it identifies a region with a high probability of containing a face, it draws a bounding box around it.

# Installation
There are no specific installation steps required for this project as it uses OpenCV, which can be installed with standard package managers like pip.

# Usage
To use this project, you need to have OpenCV installed. Then, you can run the provided Python script to perform face recognition on images or video streams.

# Example usage:

# bash
Copy code
**python face_recognition.py --image input.jpg
The script will detect faces in the input image and display the result.**
